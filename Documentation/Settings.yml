conf.py:
  ##====================================================================
  ## Define configuration data that belongs to your individual
  ## documentation project here in this ./Settings.yml file.
  ## Use "parameter: value" pairs as you would do within the conf.py
  ## file. Values given here in ./Settings.yml under the key 'conf.py'
  ## will overlay or supplement those given in conf.py. You therefore 
  ## don't have to have access to conf.py which you don't have on the
  ## server.
  ##
  ## Watch the log folder ./_not_versioned/ to see what settings have
  ## been used when the project has last been rendered. This may give
  ## you an idea of what's possible and what's needed and how to write 
  ## it.
  ##
  ## Have fun!
