.. let's include 'Includes.txt' as we do in each and every ReST file
   in this documentation project.

.. include:: ../Includes.txt


.. add a label 'sitemap' for crossreferencing:

.. _sitemap:

==================================================
                     Sitemap
==================================================


.. This is a "trick" to create a sitemap. We don't add this document
   like we normally do with a ".. toctree::" directive. Instead we link
   to the "sitemap" label.

   within the following ".. toctree::" directive we do not limit the
   output and thus get a complete sitemap with all targets we can jump
   to. We're starting the list at the master document.

.. toctree::

   ../Index

:ref:`Sitemap <sitemap>`
